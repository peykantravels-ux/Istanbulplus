# Istanbul Plus E-commerce Security Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Istanbul Plus E-commerce platform, focusing on the advanced authentication system and best practices for maintaining security.

## Authentication Security

### Password Security

#### Password Requirements

- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase and lowercase letters
- Must contain at least one number
- Must contain at least one special character
- Cannot be similar to username or email
- Cannot be a common password

#### Password Storage

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt
- Hash rounds: 12 (configurable)
- No plaintext passwords stored anywhere
- Password history tracking (prevents reuse of last 5 passwords)

#### Password Reset Security

- Secure token generation using cryptographically secure random
- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- One-time use tokens
- Rate limiting: 3 requests per hour per email
- Email verification required

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

#### OTP (One-Time Password) Security

- 6-digit random codes
- Cryptographically secure generation
- 5-minute expiration time
- Maximum 3 verification attempts
- Rate limiting: 5 OTP requests per hour per user
- Codes are hashed before storage

#### Delivery Methods

- SMS via secure gateway (Kavenegar)
- Email with HTML templates
- Both methods support rate limiting
- Delivery failure handling and retry logic

### Session Management

#### JWT Token Security

- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Longer-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
- Token rotation on refresh
- Blacklist support for revoked tokens
- Secure token storage recommendations

#### Session Tracking

- IP address logging
- User agent tracking
- Location detection (optional)
- Session termination capabilities
- Concurrent session limits

### Account Security

#### Account Locking

- Automatic lock after 3 failed login attempts
- 30-minute lock duration (configurable)
- Progressive delays for repeated failures
- Manual unlock capability for administrators
- Security event logging

#### Suspicious Activity Detection

- Multiple failed login attempts
- Login from new locations
- Unusual access patterns
- Concurrent sessions from different locations
- API abuse patterns

## Rate Limiting

### Implementation

- Redis-based rate limiting
- Per-IP and per-user limits
- Different limits for different endpoints
- Sliding window algorithm
- Graceful degradation

### Rate Limits

#### Authentication Endpoints

- Login attempts: 10 per hour per IP
- OTP requests: 5 per hour per user
- Password reset: 3 per hour per email
- Registration: 5 per hour per IP

#### API Endpoints
