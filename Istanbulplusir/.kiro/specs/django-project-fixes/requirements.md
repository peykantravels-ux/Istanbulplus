### Requirement 2: Resolve Deprecated Package Warnings

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate deprecated package warnings, so that the application runs without unnecessary warnings and remains compatible with future Python versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running any Django management command THEN the system SHALL NOT display pkg_resources deprecation warnings
2. WHEN using JWT authentication THEN the system SHALL use updated package versions that don't rely on deprecated APIs
3. IF setuptools version conflicts exist THEN requirements.txt SHALL specify compatible setuptools version constraints

### Requirement 3: Add Missing Favicon and Static File Handling

3. IF static files are missing THEN appropriate default files SHALL be created

### Requirement 4: Improve Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues in development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly logged with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN running in development mode THEN detailed error information SHALL be available
3. IF broken pipe errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully without affecting user experience

### Requirement 5: Enhance Security Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper security configurations, so that the application is protected against common vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in production THEN SECRET_KEY SHALL be loaded from environment variables
2. WHEN handling file uploads THEN proper file type validation SHALL be implemented
3. IF CORS is configured THEN it SHALL only allow necessary origins

### Requirement 6: Add Production Configuration Template

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a production configuration template, so that I can deploy the application securely without guessing configuration requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN a prod.py settings file template SHALL be available
2. WHEN configuring production THEN database, cache, and security settings SHALL be properly documented
3. IF environment variables are required THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with examples

### Requirement 7: Implement Proper OTP SMS Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive OTP codes via SMS for authentication, so that I can securely access my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting OTP in production THEN SMS SHALL be sent via a real SMS provider
2. WHEN testing OTP functionality THEN development mode SHALL print codes to console
3. IF SMS provider fails THEN appropriate error handling SHALL inform the user

### Requirement 8: Fix Template Syntax Errors
